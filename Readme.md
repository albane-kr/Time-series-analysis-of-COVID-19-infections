This folder has files for the technical deliverable of the BSP3 of Albane Keraudren-Riguidel.

The "johns_hopkins" file is the script to create the "covid19_final_with_italy.csv". The script works by first downloading the data in this link https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 .

"covid19.Rmd" is the file in which the data was processed, analyzed and put into an interactive dashboard.

To make the script run in all R scripts, it is required to set the working directory to your own, as well as the path where you store the data.
