This folder has files for the technical deliverable of the Bachelor Semester Project 3 of Albane Keraudren-Riguidel. (October-December 2023)

The "johns_hopkins" file contains the script to create the "covid19_final_with_italy.csv." The script works by first downloading the data from this link: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

"covid19.Rmd" is the file in which the data was processed, analyzed and put into an interactive dashboard.

To make the script run in all R scripts, you must set your own working directory and the path where you store the data.
